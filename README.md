The Asclepius Healthcare Policy

Preamble:
The Asclepius Healthcare Policy is established to provide equitable, universal healthcare for all individuals in the United States, irrespective of age, race, color, gender, or socioeconomic status. It is designed to operate as a system for the people, by the people, ensuring that no one in need of healthcare is denied access.

1. Establishment of the Council of Asclepius

Composition: The Council will consist of 12 Congressional representatives, referred to as "Asclepts," who are licensed medical doctors with advanced qualifications:

Each member must possess a Clinical Licensure and Certification.

Each member must hold a Ph.D. or an equivalent advanced medical research qualification.

Members will be selected based on proven life-saving contributions, innovative practices in medicine, and peer-reviewed achievements in healthcare.

Election Process:

Members are elected by public vote, with candidates nominated based on their professional merits and community impact.

Each Asclept can serve up to two terms, with each term lasting four years.

Role: The Council of Asclepius will oversee the policy’s implementation, ensuring adherence to its principles, and advise Congress on healthcare reforms and resource allocations.

Ethical Standards:

Asclepts are held to the highest ethical and moral standards, embodying compassion, professionalism, and a commitment to serving others.

Actions such as promiscuity, uncontrolled physical violence, or other behaviors that reflect poorly on the position are grounds for dismissal.

Asclepts must not derive personal financial gain from medical innovations or practices, and violations of this rule are fireable offenses.

Compensation:

Each Asclept receives an annual salary of $400,000.

2. Universal Coverage

Eligibility:

Every individual residing in the United States is automatically enrolled, regardless of citizenship, employment status, or pre-existing conditions.

Scope of Coverage:

Primary care, emergency services, hospitalization, mental health services, prescription medications, preventive care, and long-term care.

No out-of-pocket expenses for essential services.

3. Funding and Sustainability

Revenue Source:

The policy is funded through an irrevocable taxation framework that reallocates a fixed percentage of government spending.

Funds are drawn from non-essential discretionary budgets, ensuring minimal disruption to essential services.

Transparency:

Annual public audits will be conducted to ensure accountability and efficiency in resource allocation.

An independent watchdog group will oversee spending and report directly to the Council of Asclepius and Congress.

4. Administration and Implementation

Peoples Allied Healthcare System (PAHS):

A non-profit entity established to administer healthcare services under the Asclepius Healthcare Policy.

PAHS will manage provider networks, negotiate fair pricing for medications and treatments, and maintain high standards of care.

Regional Offices:

Local branches will ensure that healthcare services are tailored to meet community needs while adhering to national standards.

5. Equality and Accessibility

Non-Discrimination Clause:

No individual shall be denied healthcare based on age, race, gender, color, disability, or any other status.

Accessibility:

Rural and underserved areas will receive prioritized funding to eliminate disparities in healthcare access.

Telemedicine and mobile clinics will be deployed to reach remote communities.

6. Protections and Guarantees

Legislative Safeguards:

The policy’s funding mechanism cannot be amended or repealed without a supermajority vote (two-thirds of Congress) and approval through a national referendum.

Patient Bill of Rights:

Every individual has the right to timely, high-quality, and compassionate care.

Appeals processes will be in place for grievances related to care denial or quality concerns.

7. Research and Innovation

Investment in Medical Research:

A portion of the budget will be allocated to advancing medical technologies and treatments.

Partnerships with universities, hospitals, and private researchers will be fostered to promote innovation.

Medication Standards:

The development of medications with no side effects is a primary goal.

Medications with severe side effects (rated 3 or above on a standardized scale) must be shelved immediately and reported to a public listing for transparency.

Education and Workforce Development:

Scholarships and incentives will be provided to train the next generation of healthcare professionals, focusing on underserved specialties.

Conclusion:
The Asclepius Healthcare Policy represents a bold and inclusive approach to ensuring that every individual in the United States has access to the healthcare they deserve. By anchoring its funding and administration in law and accountability, it seeks to create a system that is both sustainable and responsive to the evolving needs of the people.
